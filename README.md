# Demo data project: Vintage Clothing Small Business

This repository is the demo version of a data project I built for vintage clothing small business. It has been reproduced with mock-up data to keep real customers and business data safe. As such, the live API sync will not work, but I have included the original files for technical completeness. Instead, run `test_data.py` to generate mock data and use `load_csv_data.py` to load it into the database.
